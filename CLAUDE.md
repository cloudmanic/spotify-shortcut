# Project Instructions

## File Headers

Every source file must include the following header at the top:

```
//
// Date: YYYY-MM-DD
// Author: Spicer Matthews <spicer@cloudmanic.com>
// Copyright (c) YYYY Cloudmanic Labs, LLC. All rights reserved.
//
// Description: [Brief description of what this file does]
//
```

Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the current date and `YYYY` with the current year.

## Code Style

- Put detailed comments above every function (public and private)
- One test file per source file
- Imports should be grouped in this order, separated by blank lines:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Aliased imports
